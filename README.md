This is a refactor of [my original vanilla JavaScript Blackjack game](https://github.com/ThinkerDreamer/animated-spoon/tree/main/blackjack), made again with components in Svelte to practice using this new framework.

I created components, used stores, and deployed on Render.com.

Let me know if you find any bugs!
